Packages to Install Before Running the Code:


Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Use Beautiful Soup to access personality type descirptions from enneagraminstitute.com (Enneagram), 16personalities.com (MBTI), and verywell.com (Big Five). Wasn't necessary to use Beautiful Soup but was useful for learning purposes and becoming familiar with the package
2. Create a word cloud for each of the personaity types (example below) after removing stop words, punctuation, and common words such as "personality", "type", etc
