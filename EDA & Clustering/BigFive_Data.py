ocean_traits = {'openness': "This trait features characteristics such as imagination and insight. People who are high in this trait also tend to have a broad range of interests. They are curious about the world and other people and eager to learn new things and enjoy new experiences. People who are high in this trait tend to be more adventurous and creative. People low in this trait are often much more traditional and may struggle with abstract thinking. High Very creative Open to trying new things Focused on tackling new challenges Happy to think about abstract concepts Low Dislikes change Does not enjoy new things Resists new ideas Not very imaginative Dislikes abstract or theoretical concepts Openness, also often referred to as openness/intellect or open to experience, is one of the Big Five factors of personality. The Big Five theory suggests that personality is composed of five major dimensions. Each dimension represents a continuum, so you can be high, low, or somewhere in the middle with regards to each trait. In addition to openness, the Big Five include: Conscientiousness Extraversion Agreeableness Neuroticism This trait taxonomy is a useful tool for thinking about personality, and research suggests that these five dimensions can play a part in predicting life outcomes in areas that include physical health, mental health, school, work, and social relationships. People who tend to be high in the trait of openness are more willing to embrace new things, fresh ideas, and novel experiences. They are open-minded and approach new things with curiosity and tend to seek out novelty. They tend to pursue new adventures, experiences, and creative endeavors. They are also very good at thinking about and making connections between different concepts and ideas. People who are low on openness, on the other hand, tend to prefer routines, traditions, and familiarity. They approach new things with great caution and prefer consistency. Individuals who are very low on the trait of openness are often seen as being rigid and close-minded. They may find it difficult to cope with changes. Individuals who are low in this trait may pass up opportunities to try new things, including changes that could lead to academic or career advancement. Rather than move to a new place to go to a different school or make a career change to find a more rewarding job, they may stick with what is routine and familiar. According to one definition: “Openness/Intellect reflects imagination, creativity, intellectual curiosity, and appreciation of esthetic experiences. Broadly, Openness/Intellect relates to the ability and interest in attending to and processing complex stimuli.” People who are high in this trait are more likely to seek out new experiences. They enjoy things that are new, different, and surprising. They are also more likely to pay attention to their feelings and inner experiences. People who are high in openness tend to have many of the following characteristics: Creative Intelligent and knowledgeable Give great attention to mental imagery Interested in new things Enjoys hearing new ideas Likes thinking about abstract concepts Usually more liberal and open to diversity Interested in artistic endeavors Adventurous Openness to experience also tends to be correlated to another psychological trait known as absorption, which involves the ability to become immersed in imagination or fantasy. This construct may also be linked to hypnotic susceptibility, or the tendency to be hypnotizable. Causes A person's tendency to be either open or closed to experience are likely influenced by both genetics and experience. In psychology, this is often known as the nature or nurture debate. The nature side of the debate argues that certain psychological tendencies are largely caused by heritable factors, while the nurture side of the debate suggests that experience and environmental factors play the most pivotal role. Twin studies of the Big Five personality traits suggest that heritability accounts for between 40% to 60% of the individual variance in traits. While there is not a great deal of research available on the specific causes of each individual trait, one study found that 21% of differences in openness between individuals was due to heritability. Another study suggested that approximately 10% of the variance in novelty-seeking was due to genetic inheritance. Openness to experience, like the other four factors of personality, is usually measured using self-report inventories. These questionnaires typically contain a number of statements and people then choose a response that best reflects how much they agree with the statement. For example, a typical inventory might contain a series of statements similar to the following and respondents then select a response between 1 (strongly disagree) and 5 (strongly agree). If you are curious about how you might rate yourself on this personality trait, this informal quiz can give you a general idea. Examples of statements that you might find related to openness include: I'm good at coming up with new ideas. I often think about the deeper meaning of things. I'm curious about how things work.  I enjoy thinking about theoretical ideas. I have many artistic hobbies. I place a high value on aesthetics and artistry. I have an active imagination. I appreciate being around diverse groups of people. I enjoy having philosophical discussions. I tend to daydream or get distracted by flights of fancy.  I like going to cultural events, art museums, and poetry readings. I would prefer to have a theoretical discussion rather than making small talk. If you strongly agree with most or all of these statements, then you are likely very open to experience. If you moderately agree with all or some of these statements, you are probably like most people and fall somewhere in the middle of the openness spectrum. If you disagree with all or most of these statements, then you might be lower on openness. The advantage of this type of measurement is that self-reports tend to be very quick and easy to administer. One potential downside, however, is the tendency respondents sometimes have to answer in ways that are more socially desirable. In other instances, people select answers that reflect how they want to see themselves, rather than choose answers that are more reflective of their true behavior. Openness is often viewed as a positive trait. Open people have a higher level of intrinsic motivation to pursue knowledge for its own sake. They are curious about the world and want to learn more about how it works. They are also eager to try new things, so they may be better able to adapt and thrive when faced with changes in their environment, situation, or relationships. This doesn’t mean that openness doesn’t have any downsides. Because people who are high on this trait seek novelty, they may also be more willing to engage in risky behaviors. Interestingly, however, some studies have linked decreased openness to increased risk for drug use. Creativity Of the five traits described by the big five theory, openness to experience is the only personality factor that research consistently links to creativity. People who are high in openness tend to be more creative in general, are more likely to pursue creative achievements, engage in divergent thinking, and take part in creative hobbies.  One study found that openness predicted creative achievement in the arts, where being high in the sub-component of intellect predicted creative successes in the sciences. Artists and scientists often score higher on tests of this trait than do people who work in other professions. Because people with high levels of openness are interested in new things, they are often motivated to learn about new ideas and acquire new knowledge. Research has found that openness to experience is correlated with intelligence as well as what is known as crystallized intelligence. This type of intelligence involves the ability to use all of the facts and knowledge that a person acquires throughout life. Openness to experience has also been linked to what is known as the need for cognition. The need for cognition is a tendency to pursue activities that necessitate thinking, including thinking about ideas and engaging in mentally complex tasks. People who have a high need for cognition enjoy doing things like solving puzzles, brainstorming solutions to problems, and analyzing ideas. When listening to an argument, people who are high on cognition tend to focus on aspects of the ideas themselves, where people who are low on this need pay greater attention to things like the likability of the person presenting the argument. Studies have also found that openness is linked to social and political attitudes. People who are high on openness also tend to be more politically liberal. They are more open and accepting toward people of diverse social, cultural, and religious backgrounds. Studies have also found that openness is negatively correlated with right-wing authoritarianism and conservative political views. However, while openness is linked to certain social and political attitudes, it is important to remember that the development of such beliefs is far more complex than a singular personality trait. While the traditional view has long been that personality traits play a role in the formation of later political attitudes, some research suggests that the correlation between the two may be a result of underlying genetic factors. Such research suggests that other traits including conscientiousness, the need for order, intolerance of ambiguity, the need for closure, and fear of threats also play an important part in shaping overall political views. Openness can also play a role in relationships. While openness seems to play a less pivotal role than some of the other factors of personality, it has been shown to play an important role with regard to sex. People who are high in openness tend to be more informed about sexual relationships, have a more open attitude toward sex, and have more sexual experiences. Research has also found an association between women’s high levels of openness and their sexual satisfaction in their marriages. Another study suggested that openness plays a role in determining the frequency of sex in married couples. As with other traits, openness to experience and knowledge represents a continuum. Some people tend to be very high on this trait and some people very low, but the majority of people lie somewhere in the middle. There is little information available on what percentage of people tend to be high, low, or average on this trait. However, psychologist Robert McCrae, one of the key researchers whose work has contributed to the understanding of the five factors of personality, suggests that openness tends to follow a normal distribution curve, with most people scoring moderately on the trait and a smaller number scoring very high or very low. McCrae and his colleagues have also found that the five factors tend to vary with age. Although each individual is different, his research suggests that openness to experience peaks around the age of 19. Such findings suggest that while younger people may be more willing to embrace change, this openness to new ideas and experiences may progressively decline as people age. One study looking at cross-cultural differences in personality traits found that the nation where an individual lived had a statistically significant impact on openness. Results from self-report measures of the Big Five traits found that people from Chile and Belgium rated the highest on openness, while respondents from Japan and Hong Kong ranked the lowest. Regional analysis revealed that East Asia scored lower on openness than all other world regions, while South America scored higher than all other world regions. Openness can play a role in different areas of life including your creative pursuits, your political ideology, and your attitudes toward sex, among other things. It is important to remember, however, that personality traits such as openness are just one of many factors that shape your life. Personality has been associated with a number of life outcomes including happiness, relationship quality, and job satisfaction, but other factors including circumstances, both situational and societal, also play a critical role.",
                'conscientiousness': "Standard features of this dimension include high levels of thoughtfulness, good impulse control, and goal-directed behaviors. Highly conscientious people tend to be organized and mindful of details. They plan ahead, think about how their behavior affects others, and are mindful of deadlines. High Spends time preparing Finishes important tasks right away Pays attention to detail Enjoys having a set schedule Low Dislikes structure and schedules Makes messes and doesn't take care of things Fails to return things or put them back where they belong Procrastinates important tasks Fails to complete necessary or assigned tasks If you have recently taken a personality test and scored high in conscientiousness, you may be wondering what that means for you. Conscientiousness is one of the Big Five personality traits, which theorizes that there are five major dimensions to personality including openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Psychologists often use the acronym OCEAN when referring to the Big Five personality test. Even though you may have scored high in conscientiousness, that doesn't mean that you won't find other aspects of the Big Five within your personality. After all, each dimension is viewed on a continuum, which means while you may be dominant in conscientiousness, you still have some level of the other five represented. You simply may be high, low, or somewhere in the middle when it comes to each trait. The Big Five also is a useful tool for understanding personality traits and is helpful in identifying how people respond to different scenarios or stressors in their lives. When someone is conscientious, they are able to exercise self-discipline and self-control in order to pursue and ultimately achieve their goals. Typically, people who score high in conscientiousness are organized, determined, and able to postpone immediate gratification for the sake of long-term success. While some people are more likely to choose what's good or fun at the moment, conscientious people tend to work diligently toward achieving their goals. They also are responsible, goal-oriented, reliable, organized, and hard-working. And they pay attention to details to make sure that they deliver on their promises. Being conscientious tends to come with a number of benefits too. For instance, people who are conscientious tend to get better grades in school and are seen as better employees in the workforce. They often have good reputations that are defined by their commitment, reliability, and productivity. Research has even shown that high conscientiousness may help lead to higher incomes. Overall, conscientious people rarely make impulsive or careless decision. Here are some other ways to describe conscientious people: Organized Principled Responsible Forward-thinking Persistent Goal-oriented Although most people assume that being conscientious is a good thing, there are some potential downsides to this personality trait. For instance, people who are conscientious can become too serious and may need a gentle shove in order to lighten up and have some fun. They also can burn themselves out by overworking, become overly rigid or inflexible, and struggle to be spontaneous. In extreme cases, they may struggle with perfectionism and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Meanwhile, people who are low in conscientiousness tend to prioritize having fun at the moment. They are often described as casual, laid-back, and relaxed. And, they balk at schedules and extensive planning. Sometimes people low in conscientiousness are viewed as irresponsible and unpredictable. But they also are more likely to step outside of the box and may respond well to last-minute demands. When it comes to determining conscientiousness and the other four traits in the Big Five, most people complete a self-report questionnaire. These inventories usually contain statements where test takers must decide to what degree they agree or disagree with those statements. Because conscientiousness is measured through an inventory and is considered a dimension or your personality, it's difficult to determine the prevalence of conscientiousness among the general public. After all, it is not a diagnosis but simply an aspect of personality that helps people better understand why they do the things they do. What's more, each person has some level of conscientiousness that exists along a continuum. So, people tend to be very high in conscientiousness, very low, or somewhere in between. When someone tests high in conscientiousness, they are likely very dependable and organized. They also tend to be able to control their impulses. In fact, multiple studies have shown that being conscientious can lead to better overall health and higher productivity.2﻿ For instance, people who score high in conscientiousness tend to smoke, drink and use drugs less frequently than other people. Within the trait of conscientiousness, there are six facets or sub-traits that further describe the person's personality. These include being achievement-oriented, cautious, dutiful, orderly, self-disciplined, and prone to self-efficacy. Here is an overview of these traits. Achievement-Oriented People who score high in conscientiousness tend to be high achievers. They are always striving for excellence in everything they do. Consequently, they are often extremely ambitious and tend to have lofty goals. Meanwhile, those that score lower in conscientiousness may sometimes be viewed as lazy. They may be more content with doing minimal work or skimping on responsibilities. Cautious If someone scores high in conscientiousness, they are likely to carefully consider all the facts before making decisions. They tend to think through most things and consider the consequences before finally acting. Conscientious people tend to analyze situations and weigh the pros and cons before moving forward. On the other hand, people with low scores tend to be impulsive and take greater risks. Dutiful When someone scores high in conscientiousness, they are typically a very reliable person with a strong sense of duty and moral obligation. They honor their commitments and follow through on their promises. People who score low in conscientiousness tend to view rules and regulations as restricting, limiting, and confining. They may not feel responsible for anyone other than themselves. Consequently, low scorers may be viewed as irresponsible and insubordinate. Orderly Typically, when someone is high in conscientiousness they are highly organized and thrive with schedules and routines. They may enjoy list-making and are often punctual. Many times, people describe them as self-starters who are both orderly and neat, while someone low in this trait may appear more disorganized or scatter-brained. Self-Disciplined People who score high in conscientiousness are often very self-disciplined. They tend to persevere even when things get difficult or unpleasant. What's more, they are able to stay focused and stick to the task at hand even with they are faced with multiple distractions. Low conscientiousness, however, may lead to the failure to complete tasks that may be perceived as too difficult. Prone to Self-Efficacy When someone scores high in conscientiousness, they often have complete confidence in their ability to reach their goals and be successful. They also tend to believe in themselves and their abilities and have a great deal of ambition to see things through to the end. Conversely, people who score low in conscientiousness tend to feel ineffective. They also believe that they have no control over their lives. If you are a conscientious person, there are some common behaviors that you are likely to witness in your life. For instance, here are some things that you might say about yourself. Try to always be prepared Pay attention to details Like order and organization Plan ahead and follow a schedule Get work done right away Like to be precise and pay attention to details Work hard and produce high-quality work Like for things to be neat, clean, and organized Even though you may have scored high in conscientiousness, it's important to remember that this personality trait is just one part of your overall personality. You still have other traits that help round out your personality. So, while understanding conscientiousness may help you know why you do what you do, it is not your only defining trait. Typically, your personality will contain some level of all five traits. Make sure you are open to exploring all dimensions of your personality.",
                'extraversion': "Extraversion (or extroversion) is characterized by excitability, sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness, and high amounts of emotional expressiveness. People who are high in extraversion are outgoing and tend to gain energy in social situations. Being around other people helps them feel energized and excited. People who are low in extraversion (or introverted) tend to be more reserved and have less energy to expend in social settings. Social events can feel draining and introverts often require a period of solitude and quiet in order to \"recharge.\" High Enjoys being the center of attention Likes to start conversations Enjoys meeting new people Has a wide social circle of friends and acquaintances Finds it easy to make new friends Feels energized when around other people Say things before thinking about them Low Prefers solitude Feels exhausted when having to socialize a lot Finds it difficult to start conversations Dislikes making small talk Carefully thinks things through before speaking Dislikes being the center of attention In the big 5 theory of personality, extroversion (often known as extraversion) is one of the five core traits believed to make up human personality. Extroversion is characterized by sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness, and excitability.People who are high in extroversion tend to seek out social stimulation and opportunities to engage with others. These individuals are often described as being full of life, energy, and positivity. In group situations, extroverts (extraverts) are likely to talk often and assert themselves. Introverts, on the other hand, are people who are low in extroversion. They tend to be quiet, reserved and less involved in social situations. It is important to note that introversion and shyness are not the same. People low in extroversion are not afraid of social situations. They simply prefer to spend more time alone and do not need as much social stimulation. Extroverts are often unfairly pegged as overly talkative or attention-seeking. In reality, they simply gain energy from engaging in social interaction. People who are high in extroversion need social stimulation to feel energized. They gain inspiration and excitement from talking and discussing ideas with other people. Extroversion is often marked by a number of different sub-traits, such as: Warmth Novelty- and excitement-seeking Gregariousness Assertiveness Cheerfulness Talkativeness Enjoying being the center of attention Action-oriented Friendly Engaging The exact reason why people tend to be more extroverted or more introverted has been the subject of considerable debate and research in psychology. As with many such debates, the question tends to boil down to two key contributors: nature or nurture. Genetics: Extroversion clearly has a strong genetic component. Twin studies suggest that genetics contribute somewhere between 40% and 60% of the variance between extroversion and introversion. Environment: Sibling studies published in 2011 have suggested that individual experiences carry greater weight than do shared experiences in families. Variability in this trait may be linked to differences in cortical arousal. Extroverts tend to need more external stimulation while introverts tend to become stimulated very easily, according to some researchers. How does extroversion affect behavior? Researchers have found that being high in this personality trait is linked to a number of different tendencies. In addition to contributing to personalities, this trait may also play a role in career choices. According to researchers, extroversion is associated with leadership behavior. Since extroverts are more likely to assert themselves in groups, it makes sense that they often take on leadership roles when working with other people. Those high in extroversion are often described as having a very positive outlook on life as well as being friendly, energetic, and highly adaptable. As you might imagine, high levels of extroversion can be particularly well suited to jobs that require a great deal of interaction with other people. Teaching, sales, marketing, public relations, and politics are all jobs in which an extrovert might do well. Introverts prefer less social interaction, so jobs that require lots of independent work are often ideal. Writing, computer programming, engineering, and accounting are all jobs that might appeal to a person low in extroversion. While it might seem like everyone in your circle of friends and acquaintances is more extroverted than you, recent research actually indicates that extroversion is less common than previously thought. In a study published in 2015, researchers found that extroverts tend to be overrepresented in social networks. Because outgoing, popular people tend to have a lot of friends, they are disproportionately represented in social networks. The researchers also suggested that there are two key factors that determine who people become friends with. Extroverts tend to be very sociable, making them more likely to form new friendships than introverts. People also tend to form friendships with people with similar levels of extroversion as themselves. While extroverts are more likely to become friends with other extroverts, introverts tend to forge relationships with both introverts and extroverts. To extroverts, it seems like most people are also extroverted because that personality trait is overrepresented among their group of friends and acquaintances. Introverts, however, might have a better grasp of the true structure of social networks.",
                'agreeableness': "This personality dimension includes attributes such as trust, altruism, kindness, affection, and other prosocial behaviors. People who are high in agreeableness tend to be more cooperative while those low in this trait tend to be more competitive and sometimes even manipulative. High Has a great deal of interest in other people Cares about others Feels empathy and concern for other people Enjoys helping and contributing to the happiness of other people Assists others who are in need of help Low Takes little interest in others Doesn't care about how other people feel Has little interest in other people's problems Insults and belittles others Manipulates others to get what they wan When it comes to personality traits, if you're someone that has scored high in agreeableness, you're likely popular and tend to make friends easily. You also may be seen as trustworthy, altruistic, honest, modest, empathetic, and cooperative. Agreeableness is one of the Big Five personality traits, which theorizes that there are five major dimensions to personality. Each dimension is viewed on a continuum, which means while you may be dominant in one area—like agreeableness—you still have some level of the other four traits represented in your personality as well. In addition to agreeableness, the other Big Five traits include openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and neuroticism. OCEAN is the acronym commonly used by psychologists to help people remember all five traits. Overall, the Big Five is a useful tool for considering and learning more about personality traits. It's also useful in identifying and predicting how people will respond in different situations. Overall, agreeableness describes a person's ability to put other people's needs above their own. For instance, people who are high in agreeableness naturally experience empathy and tend to get tremendous pleasure from serving others and taking care of them. Agreeable people also are trusting and forgiving and would rather collaborate than compete with others. Clearly, scoring high in agreeableness can be advantageous in many situations because it's a key trait in attaining and maintaining popularity. Agreeable people are generally well-liked and a joy to be around. Most people consider them good friends. Although agreeableness has many positive aspects, there are some downsides. For instance, agreeable people may struggle to assert their wants, needs, and preferences. They also struggle in situations that require tough decisions or tough love. And when it comes to their careers, they may be so intent on helping others get ahead that they forget to plan their own advancement. Meanwhile, people who score low in agreeableness tend to be more hostile, antagonistic, and competitive. They also tend to have more difficult relationships that are riddled with disagreements and breakups. Here are some common characteristics of people who score high in agreeableness: Get along well with others Are popular and well-liked Care for others in need Are helpful, kind, and considerate Display sensitivity Are socially and emotionally intelligent De-escalate conflict Refrain from judging people Give others the benefit of the doubt Like to collaborate Form friendships easily Tend to be altruistic and perceptive Are emotionally supportive Like the other four factors of personality, agreeableness is usually measured using self-report inventories. These questionnaires typically contain statements where the person taking the test decides if they agree with the statement, disagree with the statement, or fall somewhere in between. Because agreeableness is measured with self-report questionnaires and is considered a dimension of personality and not a diagnosis, there is not a lot of information available on the prevalence of agreeableness among the general population. Instead, each person has some level of agreeableness that exists along a continuum. In other words, you are either very high in agreeableness, very low, or somewhere in between. When it comes to personality testing, measuring a person's agreeableness determines their ability to be kind, empathetic, trusting, cooperative, and sympathetic. In other words, it shows how well the person meshes with society. Within the trait of agreeableness, there are six facets or sub-traits that further illustrate what makes a person agreeable: Altruism Cooperation Modesty Straightforwardness Sympathy Trust Here is an overview of these traits: Altruistic People who are agreeable feel good when they are helping others. What's more, they get tremendous internal rewards for doing good deeds and do not view it as self-sacrificing. They get a sense of fulfillment from the act itself. Meanwhile, those who score low in agreeableness feel like helping others is an imposition. And even though they may recognize it, they often have no desire to change their behavior. Cooperative When someone scores high in agreeableness, they will go to great lengths to avoid confrontations with other people. They like to be seen as peacemakers, but will often compromise their own needs and interests to get along with other people. On the other hand, people who score low in agreeableness are prone to forcing their will on other people. They also will use intimidation and aggression to get their own way. Honest If someone scores high in agreeableness, they tend to be straightforward and sincere. They rarely feel the need to manipulate people to get what they want. Likewise, they are viewed as genuine, loving people who are easy to relate to. But, if a person scores low in agreeableness, they may feel there is nothing wrong with being deceptive, especially when it's more convenient. They also may be more secretive. Modest People who score high in agreeableness are very down-to-earth and rarely claim to be better than others. They also are usually humble—sometimes to the point that they may have lower self-esteem. Meanwhile, someone who scores low in agreeableness might be more arrogant or not above taking advantage of other people. They also may try to do more to show that they are superior to others. Sympathetic When someone scores high in agreeableness, they are often very sympathetic and are easily moved to have care and concern for others. They also are emotionally intelligent and very empathetic, often relating to the pain and suffering of other people. People who score low in agreeableness are not inclined to be merciful and may not feel empathy. Trusting If someone scores high in agreeableness, they are prone to assume that other people have good intentions and mean well. They can also be slow to make judgments about other people and often care for people unconditionally. On the other hand, if someone scores low in agreeableness they tend to view others as selfish and believe they are only out for their own interests. They also may see people as a threat to their own interests and well-being. Overall, if you are an agreeable person, there are some common behaviors that probably occur pretty consistently in your life. Here are some common ways that people who are high in agreeableness behave. Look for yourself in these scenarios: Put the interests of others before their own May engage in people-pleasing behavior Need affirmation from others Are kind, considerate, and helpful Tend to get involved in altruistic activities or community events Will compromise on their ideas and ideals if it reduces conflict Refrain from being abrasive or contradicting Try to be honest and sincere in words and deeds Remember, personality traits—like agreeableness—represent just one factor in determining who you are. Even if you score high in agreeableness, you still have some level of the other traits within your personality. So, while understanding agreeableness can help you make sense of your tendencies, it's not your only defining characteristic. Every person has some dimension of the remaining Big Five traits in their life. Be open to exploring all areas of your personality.",
                'neuroticism': "Neuroticism is a trait characterized by sadness, moodiness, and emotional instability. Individuals who are high in this trait tend to experience mood swings, anxiety, irritability, and sadness. Those low in this trait tend to be more stable and emotionally resilient. High Experiences a lot of stress Worries about many different things Gets upset easily Experiences dramatic shifts in mood Feels anxious Struggles to bounce back after stressful events Low Emotionally stable Deals well with stress Rarely feels sad or depressed Doesn't worry much Is very relaxed Do you struggle with neuroticism? Neuroticism is one of the \"Big Five\" personality traits, along with extraversion, openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness (OCEAN or CANOE are the acronyms sometimes used to remember these traits). These broad categories reflect enduring personality traits that have been identified as common ways of categorizing across individuals. This concept has roots in Freudian times but was later expanded upon by Hans Eysenck and others. Neuroticism has come to be known as the trait reflecting emotional stability or the tendency to become easily aroused when stimulated (or the inability to calm oneself down easily when upset or worried). Costa and McCrae and others later defined neuroticism as a negative personality trait involving maladjustment and negative emotions, poor self-regulation or the ability to manage urges, trouble dealing with stress, strong reaction to perceived threat, and the tendency to complain. Thus, overall, neuroticism has been defined as the tendency to experience negative emotion. Neuroticism is generally measured using self-report questionnaires as part of a personality assessment. It might also involve asking other people such as friends and family who know a person well about their personality characteristics. Because neuroticism is a dimension and not a diagnosis, prevalence rates of neurotic personality are not reported as they are for diagnosable mental disorders. Instead, each person falls on a continuum of the range of neuroticism from very low to very high. In other words, we all exist on a spectrum from one end to the other when it comes to being neurotic in our behavior. What are the common neurotic traits? People who fall high on the spectrum of neuroticism tend to show the following characteristics: Overall tendency toward negative emotions Feels of anxiety or irritability Poor emotional stability Feelings of self-doubt Feelings of being self-conscious or shy Sadness, moodiness, depression Easily stressed or upset, unable to handle stress well Dramatic shifts in how you are feeling Lack of resilience or struggling to bounce back after adversity Chronic worrying about a variety of things Tendency to interpret neutral situations as threatening Tendency to view minor problems as overwhelming Difficulty controlling urges or emotions in the moment Easily becoming jealous or feeling envy about what others have Trouble with frustration or anger about everyday occurrences Feelings of fear or guilt over minor things What are the causes of neuroticism? We know that the trait appears to be universal across cultures, so it likely has biological origins. In fact, some argue that neuroticism may have an evolutionary explanation, and that in some respects being hypersensitive to danger or threats could offer a survival advantage. There is also some evidence that neuroticism may be correlated with the startle reflex. The startle reflex is a response to a loud noise. This suggests that individuals who are high in neuroticism may be genetically wired to naturally react more strongly to outside stimuli. How does neuroticism affect behavior? Both positive and negative outcomes of neuroticism have been observed. As mentioned previously, neuroticism may help individuals to succeed or survive because they have a tendency to pay more attention to negative outcomes or risks. For example, there is evidence that when neuroticism is managed, it might predict student success at university. On the other hand, neuroticism may have negative effects on behavior if you are unable to manage feelings of worry. In the worst-case scenario, neuroticism may lead to secondary mental health issues such as depression or anxiety. In fact, we know that those high on the spectrum of neuroticism are at greater risk for mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. A 2013 meta-analysis showed that a large range of clinical mental disorders are related to higher levels of neuroticism. In general, people who are high on the neuroticism scale react with quick arousal to situations and take a long time to get back to their baseline level. In other words, these individuals live with emotional instability and trouble regulating their behaviors as a result. How does neuroticism affect relationships? There are a number of negative impacts of neuroticism on the personal relationships of those who have elevated levels of this trait. Let's consider each of these in turn. Annoying Others Perhaps the most obvious complaint of those who know people who are high in neuroticism is that their behavior can become annoying to others who are in relationships with that person. For example, a neurotic person might do the following things that could grate on the nerves of those around them: Have a tendency to complain Be critical of other people Constantly ask for reassurance Be overly dependent on others or ask for help instead of figuring things out for yourself Be a drama queen or make mountains out of molehills Passing on Worries If you are high in neuroticism and have children, you might inadvertently pass on your worrying behavior to your children through modeling it to them. For example, if you tell your child that they can't play at the park because they might fall and hurt themselves, they will learn that all situations are dangerous and that they need to be watchful for threats at all times. Getting in Conflicts Being high in neuroticism can also lead to conflict with others. For example, if you become enraged over minor mistakes, such as if someone cuts you off while you are driving, then you might end up in a conflict with others. If minor problems send you over the edge, you might yell or become angry at the people you feel have caused you stress. Some people high in neuroticism might also accuse other people of doing things out of their own worry. For example, without any evidence, you might accuse your spouse of cheating, thus driving them away from you. Also, if you obsess over minor details and have trouble with perfectionism, then you might not complete tasks that other people ask you to do, thereby creating tension and conflict. Appearing Unreliable If you constantly fly off the handle, people will eventually learn that they can't rely on you to be stable. They will feel as though they can't count on you if you are going to panic at the sign of the smallest threat. In other words, if your low tolerance for stress means that any little thing can ruin your day, people will decide that you are not the person to give the job promotion to or the one that they want to spend their life with. Feeling Guilty Being highly neurotic can also lead you to feel guilty about things that are not your fault. If you apologize for every little mistake or obsess about things you've done long after it's necessary to worry about them, you may start to push people away. While you might feel as though this guilt is necessary or helpful, it's actually hurting your relationships. Coping With Neuroticism How can you cope if you live with a high level of neuroticism? The first step is to recognize that your personality can shift over time. As people age and experience different life events, they may experience shifts, although your biology will still influence your natural tendencies. That being said, if you are truly struggling with feelings of neuroticism and neurotic behavior, you might benefit from therapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to help you manage worry or mindfulness to help you manage emotions and stay in the present moment. Some things you can do on your own include working on practicing daily gratitude so that small annoyances can be viewed from the big picture, as well as engaging in a daily meditation practice. It's important to keep in mind that having a high level of neuroticism doesn't make you a bad person. If you have a natural tendency toward neurotic behavior, the best thing you can do is to accept the situation and then work on making the best of it. The positive side of the equation is that it means you are sensitive and aware in a way that some others might not be. You are also likely to be the one who is always looking out for other people and trying to be sensitive to their feelings. If you can combine these positives with some inner work to learn how to better manage your negative thoughts and emotions, then you can channel your neurotic behavior in the best possible direction so that it serves you rather than detracts from you. In other words, learn your strengths and capitalize on them while at the same time working to mitigate the effects of your weaknesses."
